Raw text from PDF:
---
${text}
---

You have also been given an image of each page of this paper, in page order
starting from page 1. Use them to read diagrams, graphs, maps, and figures
that the raw text above cannot capture, and to correctly transcribe any
question whose wording depends on one (e.g. "using the diagram above...",
a graph to read values from, a map to label, a circuit to analyse).

Instructions:
- Identify every question — MCQ, structured, and essay
- For MCQ: capture all 4 options and identify the correct answer if shown
- For structured/essay questions with sub-parts: capture ONE "parts" entry
  per LEAF sub-part, not per top-level part. If a part is further divided
  — e.g. (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b)(i), (b)(ii), (c)(i)-(iii) — use a dotted
  label combining them: "a.i", "a.ii", "b.i", "b.ii", "c.i", "c.ii", "c.iii".
  A part with no further sub-division just keeps its own letter: "a". Give
  each leaf entry ONLY its own mark allocation, not its parent part's total
  (e.g. if (a) is worth 4 marks split across (a)(i)=2 and (a)(ii)=2, record
  two entries of 2 marks each, not one entry of 4).
- For essay questions with no sub-parts: capture the full question and any
  guidance given, with an empty "parts" array
- Determine the difficulty level (1-5) based on complexity
- Assign the correct section: A (MCQ), B (Structured), C (Essay)
- Marks: Section A = 1, Section B = varies (check the paper), Section C = 20
- Most questions are text-only — set "hasImage": true ONLY when the
  question is genuinely unanswerable without seeing a specific diagram,
  graph, map, or figure (e.g. "using the diagram above, identify...", a
  graph to read values from, a map to label, a circuit to analyse). A
  neighbouring question on the same page that happens to also mention a
  figure it doesn't itself depend on should stay "hasImage": false — do
  not propagate true to every question on a page just because that page
  contains a diagram somewhere.
- When "hasImage" is true, set "imagePage" to that page's number
  (1-indexed, matching the order the images were given), and set
  "imageBoundingBox" to where the figure sits on that page — an object
  {"x":0-1, "y":0-1, "width":0-1, "height":0-1} as fractions of the page's
  full width/height (x/y = top-left corner). This MUST be a tight crop
  around just the diagram/figure itself — typically a small fraction of
  the page — never the surrounding question text or the rest of the page.
  If you cannot pinpoint a tight box confidently, set "hasImage": false
  instead of guessing a loose or full-page box.
  Otherwise (no diagram needed) set "hasImage": false, "imagePage": null,
  "imageBoundingBox": null.
